### Annotated Andrej's [nn-zero-to-hero](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero) and youtube videos:

1. As practice, I take away the content of each function or the forward/backward pass and try to write my own, after watching the videos.
2. Added more explainations and comments. If you have any gaps, you may find them helpful.
3. Some variables and methods are slightly different than his. (Result is the same)
4. Comments contain my wrong code, they show common pitfalls.
